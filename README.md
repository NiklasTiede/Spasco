<p align="justify">
  Spasco is a glorified replace function: it lets you remove or replace characters occurring 
  in file or directory names. By default it replaces whitespaces by underscores but you can easily
  customize the characters you want to remove/replace. 
</p>

<h1 id="example" ><img src="docs/example.png" width="34px"#> Example</h1>

If you have files or directories containing whitespaces in your current working
directory you can easily replace them by underscores using `spasco`:

```console
❯ ls
test dir
test file

❯ spasco
2 files/directories can be renamed:
before             after
'test dir'  --> 'test_dir'
'test file' --> 'test_file'

❯ OK to proceed with renaming? [y/n] y
All done! 1 files and 1 directories were renamed ✨ 🍰 ✨.

❯ ls
test_dir
test_file
```

<h1 id="features" ><img src="docs/features.png" width="31px"#> Features</h1>

Spasco's renaming operation can be modified. For example, the
search-value (whitespaces) and the new-value (underscores) can be
changed.

- search-values other than white spaces and new-values other than
  underscores can be chosen
- files/dirs within directories can be renamed (recurse into dirs)
- scope of the renaming action can be limited (patterns with wildcard
  characters, filename expansion)
- a log record of the renaming actions can be recorded

<h1 id="installation" ><img src="docs/installation.png" width="28px"#> Installation</h1>

Spasco is currently developed on Python 3.7 and can be easily downloaded, built and installed via `pip`.

```
pip install git+https://github.com/NiklasTiede/Spasco
```

<h1 id="configuration" ><img src="docs/configuration.png" width="34px"#> Configuration</h1>

Spasco has a configuration file that allows you to change its default
behaviour. The file is generated automatically when running spasco.

```ini
[VALUE-SETTINGS]
search_value = ' '
new_value = _

[LOG-SETTINGS]
logging_turned_on = False
logger_filename = spasco.log
logger_location = /home/niklas
```

Configuration is done through the command line interface. logging can be turned on and off and you can pick a new search-/new-value persistently.

```console
❯ spasco config --help
usage: spasco config [--show-setting] [-o true/false] [-n [filename]] [-l [pathname]] [-h, --help ]

search-value and new-value can be changed. Logging to record all renaming actions as log file can be activated.

optional arguments:
  --show-settings    Returns your current settings for logging and renaming.
  -h, --help         Show this help message and exit.

log settings:
  -o [true/false]    Log record is turned on/off.
  -f [filename]      Set up a new filename for the logger.
  -l [pathname]      Set up a new file location for the logger.

rename settings:
  -s [search_value]  Set up a new search value.
  -n [new_value]     Set up a new value which will replace the search-value.
```

The built-in usage help gives you all the information you need.

```console
❯ spasco --help
usage: spasco [-s [search_value]] [-n [new_value]] [-p [pattern_only]] [-e [except_pattern]] [-d] [-f] [-r] [-v] [-h]
              [files/directories [files/directories ...]] {config} ...
